## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using 6 separate notebooks to take advantage of parallel sessions on Kaggle. The results of the tuning are stored in the format `{layers}_{hidden units}`. Each notebook explored a different combination of layers and hidden units to optimize model performance efficiently.
